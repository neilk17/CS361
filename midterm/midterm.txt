CS361: Midterm

# Question 1:

a) 6 reflections
b) 4 assignments
c) I have attended all live lectures and watched others asynchronously
d) Was confident about most homework answers when I submitted them

# Question 2

a) HW4 was the most insightful since it gave me the best understanding of how much of an improvement threads can offer.  

b) Even though none of them were too bad HW3 was frustrating since even though most of the code was provided, I found it hard to debug my code.

(It would have been better if HW4 was before HW3 since I would be more equipped to deal with the debugging aspect)

c) If I had to resubmit my HWs it would be HW3 since I would want to make my code more robust and add colors to the set.


# Question 3
